    @parameters
    ~~~ Convert ~~~
    Automatically calculates `v` if it doesn't exist; otherwise, uses the existing `v` to calculate `speed` in different units.
    ::Where:
        #id: class
        Element type for the destination attribute (specified by __Attribute Name__).
    ::What:
        #id: attrib
        The name of the attribute to create or modify[Fold:1]. If the attribute does not exist with the given name, it will be added to the selected __Attribute Class__. This node can be used only on `float` type attributes.
        :box:
            #fold: 1
                
            Only implemented to work with speed.
    ~~~ Unit Settings ~~~
    ::To:
        #id: spduni
        Allows you to specify units for the `Speed` to convert to and the node will internally perform the conversions. There are presets for commonly used units of speed.
    ::In:
        #id: timuni
        Allows you to specify the `Time`, unless the above unit is dimensionless.
    :note:
        Mach Number is calculated with Speed of Sound at 20 Â°C in Dry Air.
    ::Multiplier:
        #id: mult
        Allows to adjust the speed which internally changes the velocity.
    ::Floating Points:
        #id: flpnts
        Increase or Decrease the floating points, useful at Mach Speed, God Speed.

== Disclaimer ==
I have created this HDA to the best of my knowledge and have tested it on various scenarios. However, this doesn't guarantee that it will always work, although it most certainly should!
